README for Flight in Wonderland
Overview
"Flight in Wonderland" is an engaging and challenging 2D side-scrolling game, inspired by the popular Flappy Bird. Set in a whimsical forest, players control a character navigating through a world filled with obstacles. The game uses a NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, enabling AI players to learn and adapt to the game environment over time.

Features
Charming Visuals: Set in a beautifully rendered forest, providing an immersive gaming experience.
Dynamic Obstacles: Players must dodge spiked balls while avoiding the ground and ceiling.
AI Learning: Implements NEAT for evolving AI, allowing for an adaptive challenge.
Customizable Difficulty: Players can adjust the game's difficulty by modifying various parameters.

Objective: Avoid spiked balls and don't touch the floor or ceiling.
Scoring: Points are earned by successfully navigating past obstacles.
AI Training
The game utilizes a NEAT algorithm to evolve AI-controlled players.
The AI learns from the environment and adapts its strategy over time.
Configuration
Adjustments can be made to the NEAT configuration by editing the config-feedforward.txt file.
Parameters like population size, mutation rates, and network structure can be modified.
